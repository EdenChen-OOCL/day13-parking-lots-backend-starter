1. Objective:
Learned about prompt engineering today.
Discovered that AI can quickly implement modular code through prompts.
Tasks can be broken down into smaller tasks and implemented in modular code, including Class and Components, through specific prompt processes.

2. Reflective
Amazed by the capabilities of AI in this regard.
Feel that the application of this technology has a broad prospect and can greatly improve programming efficiency.

3. Interpretive
Our Teacher minghao suggests that to effectively pair program with AI, one should create a personal language framework.
Doing so allows one to replicate and apply it to various programming tasks at any time.

4. Decisional
Decided to explore and develop a language framework that best suits my needs.
This will help me better utilize AI for programming and improve development efficiency.
